Title: Higher or Lower

Description:
    In this game, eight cards are randomly chosen from deck. 
    The first card is shown face up. The game asks the player to 
    predict whether the next card in the selection will have a Higher
    or lower value than the currently showing card.
    For example, say the card that's shown is a 3. The player chooses 
    "higher", and the next card is shown. If that card has a 
    higher value, the player is correct. In this example, if 
    the player had chosen "lower", they would have been incorrect.

    If the player gusses correctly, they get 20 points. If they 
    choose incorrectly, they lose 15 points. If the next card to
    be turned over has the same value as the previous card, 
    the player is incorrect.
